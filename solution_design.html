    <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to develop an upgrade kit for off-the-shelf ride-on toys designed specifically for special needs children. Current ride-on cars present significant limitations in terms of safety and control for both the children and their families. Our goal is to provide enhanced safety features, improve usability, and ensure the ride-on car becomes a reliable and enjoyable tool for mobility and recreation.</p>
    <p>This RFP seeks proposals to upgrade ride-on cars to meet specific safety, functional, and usability requirements, taking into consideration real-world scenarios like traveling to church, crossing streets, and navigating theme parks. Solutions must prioritize safety and control while accommodating the unique needs of children such as Jorge.</p>
</section>

<section id="use-cases">
    <h2>Current State and Use Cases</h2>
    <p>Currently, off-the-shelf ride-on cars have several limitations that affect their usability for special needs children and their families. These limitations primarily revolve around safety and control, which are crucial when the car is used in various real-life environments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Case 1: Traveling to Church</strong><br>
            Jorge can drive his car to church with his sister as a passenger. This requires the vehicle to travel a couple of blocks, cross streets, and traverse various terrains such as grass, pavers, rocks, driveways, and asphalt streets. Ensuring safety while transitioning between these different surfaces and crossing streets is a top priority.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Case 2: Theme Park Visits</strong><br>
            In theme parks like Disney World or childrenâ€™s museums, the ride-on car must fit into a standard elevator and have features to prevent Jorge from driving into crowds, off ledges, or into traffic. Lockout controls must ensure the adult has full control at all times.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="critical-requirements">
    <h2>Critical Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Steering Lockout:</strong> Allows the remote driver to prevent the passenger from providing any steering input. Essential for environments with hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>Drive Lockout:</strong> The remote control driver can override or disable the drive mechanism, ensuring the passenger cannot control the vehicle while the lockout is engaged.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="optional-features">
    <h2>Optional Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hot-Swappable or Upgraded Batteries:</strong> Allows for extended usage without frequent recharging.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Decals:</strong> Designed to identify the car as a medical device or wheelchair replacement using the handicap blue color.</li>
        <li><strong>Dedicated Website:</strong> A site to tell Jorge's story and provide links to purchase compatible ride-on cars and upgrade kits.</li>
        <li><strong>Bluetooth:</strong> A Bluetooth connector to let Jorge listen to music in the car.</li>
        <li><strong>Wood Cuts:</strong> Enhanced components like locking mechanisms and improved seatbelt attachment points.</li>
        <li><strong>RC Car Feature:</strong> An improved RC control with extended connection distance for easier control by Jose.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Paint Job:</strong> Customized to Jorge's preference, like the Belen golf cart or a UF design.</li>
        <li><strong>Car Programming:</strong> Programming that allows a remote button or switch to activate specific features, such as lights or sounds.</li>
    </ul>
