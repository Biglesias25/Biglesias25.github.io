        <h1>Final Project: [Caducation]</h1>
        <p>Problem Statement: In response to a Quora question, career CAD user Irne Barnard describes jumping from one CAD program to another as "It can differ a great deal or it could be an exact same clone." The top 3 most used CAD programs, AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, and Autodesk Inventor, are all over 20 years old, all receiving frequent updates over time. However, when I asked 5 participants of the FRONTIERS summer program I attended at WPI if they have heard of any of newer CAD programs like OnShape, most said it was not easy to get used to them. They said they would prefer sticking to the CAD programs they know, even in a team assignment where OnShape would have been far superior.
            Computer Aided Design software like Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks, although having similar primary features in 3D design and modeling, have UI differences that discourage CAD users from using unfamiliar software. This unfamiliarity can lead to users not using some programs in use cases they excel in. Fusion 360 offers shape optimization to reduce part weight and material used, OnShape allows for easy sharing and collaboration features, and SOLIDWORKS houses various industry applicable tools, like flow simulation. While most common CAD programs have unique, case specific tools that may lead to their use over another program, each also has UI and tools that completely differ from those of other programs.</p>
