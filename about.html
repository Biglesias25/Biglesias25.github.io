        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Career CAD user Irne Barnard shares his experience of jumping from one CAD program to another, stating that it can be difficult or even identical. The top three most used CAD programs are AutoCAD, SOLIDWORKS, and Autodesk Inventor, which are over 20 years old and receive frequent updates. However, participants in a FRONTIERS summer program at WPI found it difficult to get used to newer CAD programs like OnShape, preferring to stick to their familiar CAD programs. Computer Aided Design software like Fusion360, OnShape, and Solidworks have UI differences that discourage users from using unfamiliar software. This unfamiliarity can lead to users not using some programs in use cases they excel in. Fusion 360 offers shape optimization, OnShape allows easy sharing and collaboration, and SOLIDWORKS houses industry-specific tools like flow simulation.

            Outside of school, I spend my time learning new skills like 3D modeling, programming, and experimenting with different materials. I’m excited about the future and can’t wait to explore all the possibilities engineering has to offer. My goal is to keep learning, stay curious, and hopefully inspire others to find the same excitement I feel every time I dive into a new project.
