        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Brian Iglesias, a high school student with a big passion for engineering. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by how things work—whether it’s building robots, coding apps, or taking apart old electronics just to see what’s inside. I love the challenge of solving problems and the thrill of turning ideas into reality. From school projects to personal experiments in my garage, I’m always looking for new ways to create, innovate, and make things better.

            Outside of school, I spend my time learning new skills like 3D modeling, programming, and experimenting with different materials. I’m excited about the future and can’t wait to explore all the possibilities engineering has to offer. My goal is to keep learning, stay curious, and hopefully inspire others to find the same excitement I feel every time I dive into a new project.
            
            </p>
        <p>Feel free to explore my projects and see what I'm working on!</p>
