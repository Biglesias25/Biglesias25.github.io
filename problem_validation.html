                        <td>Coffin-Lowry Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, with more severe symptoms in males. Neurological issues may include intellectual disability, speech and hearing problems, reduced muscle tone, coordination difficulties, and in some cases, seizures and leg paralysis, leading to loss of walking ability. Characteristic facial features include a prominent brow, broad nose, and widely spaced eyes, while skeletal issues can involve a curved spine, short stature, and narrowing of the spinal canal. The disorder is caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene, and although there is no cure, treatment may involve physical and speech therapy. Life expectancy may be reduced due to cardiac and respiratory complications.</td>
                        <td>This validates my efforts by highlighting that Coffin-Lowry Syndrome often results in severe mobility issues, including the loss of walking ability. This aligns directly with your aim of developing a custom vehicle tailored to Jorge’s specific needs. By addressing the mobility limitations caused by leg paralysis and other physical challenges in CLS, my solution provides an essential tool for improving his independence and quality of life. Additionally, the emphasis on neurological and physical impairments further justifies the need for specialized features like enhanced remote control, power, and suspension to accommodate Jorge's difficulties in movement and coordination.</td>

Individuals with CLS, particularly males, often experience progressive muscle weakness, hypotonia (reduced muscle tone), and spasticity, which frequently result in the loss of the ability to walk. The disorder's complex symptoms, including intellectual disability and sensory integration issues, make it challenging for individuals to use standard mobility devices. As the condition progresses, the lack of adequate assistive technology options tailored to the unique physical and neurological impairments of CLS patients becomes a serious issue.</td>

It emphasizes that the combination of cognitive and physical impairments faced by CLS patients limits the effectiveness of conventional mobility aids, reinforcing the demand for a custom-built solution like the proposed vehicle. This article adds validity to your project by demonstrating the specific, unmet needs of individuals with severe mobility issues caused by conditions like CLS. It also emphasizes the importance of designing assistive technologies that accommodate the complex challenges posed by both neurological and physical impairments.</td>

These smart mobility aids incorporate apparatuses, systems, and processes that improve their functionality. These enhancements include features that optimize user interaction, stability, and adaptability to different physical environments, offering significant improvements over traditional mobility aids.</td>
                        <td>This patent demonstrates advancements in mobility aids by introducing "smart" features that enhance basic functionalities like stability and adaptability, which is valuable for individuals with mobility challenges. However, while the patent offers improved capabilities in general mobility devices, it does not directly address the specific needs of users with severe neurological and physical impairments, such as those caused by Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. The current design does not include features like cognitive support, sensory feedback, or nighttime visibility, which are crucial for patients with complex needs. Therefore, while the patent provides a solid foundation for mobility aid advancements, further development is necessary to address the combined physical and neurological limitations faced by users like Jorge. Your project can build on this by integrating these additional support systems, tailoring the device to users with severe mobility impairments and complex conditions.</td>

The system includes an electronic level meter, brake sensor, brake device, and brake controller. It uses an inclination angle detection module, brake detection module, brake adjustment module, and brake warning module. The system continuously monitors the wheelchair's status in real-time, analyzing user movements and brake conditions using the electronic level meter and brake sensor. The brake device is automatically controlled by the brake controller to prevent accidents such as wheelchair tipping or overturning, which could occur due to improper operation or emergency braking.</td>
                        <td>This patent introduces an important safety enhancement for electric wheelchairs, addressing the issue of accidents caused by improper use or emergency braking situations. By using real-time data to adjust the wheelchair’s braking system, it effectively reduces the risk of tipping or losing balance, which is crucial for individuals with severe mobility impairments. However, while the brake control system offers an essential safety feature, it does not focus on the broader mobility challenges faced by users with neurological and cognitive impairments, such as those seen in Coffin-Lowry Syndrome. The system could be expanded by integrating more holistic user support features, such as sensory feedback or terrain adaptability, which are crucial for users like Jorge who face complex physical and neurological conditions. Your project can build on this innovation by developing a more comprehensive mobility solution that integrates these advanced braking features with other user-centered functionalities.</td>
