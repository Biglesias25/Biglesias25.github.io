                        <td>Coffin-Lowry Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial and skeletal abnormalities, with more severe symptoms in males. Neurological issues may include intellectual disability, speech and hearing problems, reduced muscle tone, coordination difficulties, and in some cases, seizures and leg paralysis, leading to loss of walking ability. Characteristic facial features include a prominent brow, broad nose, and widely spaced eyes, while skeletal issues can involve a curved spine, short stature, and narrowing of the spinal canal. The disorder is caused by mutations in the RPS6KA3 gene, and although there is no cure, treatment may involve physical and speech therapy. Life expectancy may be reduced due to cardiac and respiratory complications.</td>
                        <td>This validates my efforts by highlighting that Coffin-Lowry Syndrome often results in severe mobility issues, including the loss of walking ability. This aligns directly with your aim of developing a custom vehicle tailored to Jorgeâ€™s specific needs. By addressing the mobility limitations caused by leg paralysis and other physical challenges in CLS, my solution provides an essential tool for improving his independence and quality of life. Additionally, the emphasis on neurological and physical impairments further justifies the need for specialized features like enhanced remote control, power, and suspension to accommodate Jorge's difficulties in movement and coordination.</td>
